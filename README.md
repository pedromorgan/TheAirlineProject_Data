TheAirlineProject_Data
======================

##XML Files##

Right now, this repo only contains the XML files for The Airline Project. Because the web version is running off MySQL databases, you should only need to clone this if you are doing data format manipulation.

Otherwise, import the tap.sql file into a database and go from there. The XML and database should be in sync 99.99% of the time.
